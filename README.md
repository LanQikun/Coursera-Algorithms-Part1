Programming Assignments (Algorithms, Part I and II by Kevin Wayne, Robert Sedgewick)
**You can get more details in https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1**

## PA-1 Percolation (Union-find)
Write a program to estimate the value of the percolation threshold via Monte Carlo simulation.
Specification: http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation.html

## PA-2 Randomized Queues and Deques (Queue and Stack)
Write a generic data type for a deque and a randomized queue. The goal of this assignment is to implement elementary data structures using arrays and linked lists, and to introduce you to generics and iterators.
Specification: http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/queues.html

## PA-3 Pattern Recognition (Sort)
Write a program to recognize line patterns in a given set of points.
Specification: http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/collinear.html

## PA-4 8 Puzzle (Priority Queues)
Write a program to solve the 8-puzzle problem (and its natural generalizations) using the A* search algorithm.
Specification: http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/8puzzle.html
